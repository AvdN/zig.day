## Format
Zig Days are full-day, collaborative programming events.

You can learn more about this format in "[Zig Day: A suggestion for better Zig meetups](https://kristoff.it/blog/zig-day/)".


## Guidelines
1. **The main goal of a Zig Day is to inspire you to make [Software You Can Love](https://softwareyoucan.love)**.

2. **Zig days are for collaboration and socialization**. Avoid working on code you can't collaborate on (e.g. because of its license) and try to have engaging conversations with other people. 

3. **Software You Can Love is high quality software**, and the only way to make high quality software is to apply systems thinking.

4. **Software You Can Love serves the end user**. Zig Days are a great opportunity to learn how to fight against user-hostile software.
