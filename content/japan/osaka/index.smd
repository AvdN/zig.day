 Zig Day Osaka is a welcoming, public, collaboration-first gathering for programmers and tinkerers across every stripe of nerddom.

The venue is  (tentatively named) **Secret Shop Osaka**—a small collaboration space in Nishinari that I've been renovating in my free time to hopefully create a flexible workshop hub: tables for laptops and small hardware, fast Wi-Fi and power, projector/screen, basic audio, a light café counter, AC, a simple presentation stage even plenty of tools for hardware projects.

Like other Zig Days, the emphasis is on making friends, pairing up, learning together, and sharing what you built at the end.

I aim to host our **first meetup in the first half of November**, since the space is secured, I would like to attempt to make this a **monthly or every other month** event in the hopes off building a local community with a focus on building software (and hardware) you can love.

Structure for the event hasn't been nailed down quite yet but expect the familiar flow:
explain projects → form groups → collaborate → show & tell. 

The event language is pretty much going to be decide by the participants, but English would be encouraged where possible.
