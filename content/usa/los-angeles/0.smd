## About:

Make friends, collaborate, and learn. Join us for the first Zig day in LA.

## What to expect:

This is a low-stakes, warm-up zig day. The venue is fairly small with only a single large wooden table in it for 8 people. If there is a lot of interest (holler at me!), I can change the reservation to a larger room at the library (to accommodate 35 people), or switch libraries. We hope to have a monthly zig day LA.Water will be provided and maybe some donuts.

## Schedule:

- 10:00 AM - 10:30AM - room / workstation setup / chat
- 10:30 AM - 11:00 AM - discuss projects, form groups, begin zig
- 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM - go to local restaurant for bite to eat (there are a few within walking distance)
- 2:00 PM - 4:15 PM - continue zig
- 4:15 PM - 4:45 PM - discuss what you learned, show off
- 4:45 PM - 5::00 PM - clean up
